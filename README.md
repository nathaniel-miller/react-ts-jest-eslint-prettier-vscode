# react-typescript-template
Initial setup for react/typescript project using jest, eslint, prettier, and vscode.

## Setup
The expectation here is that VSCode is being used and has the ESLint and Prettier extensions installed.
In order for these to work correctly, load this repository as the root directory in VSCode. It is suggested that you save it as workspace or use the included workspace file found in the `.vscode` directory.
